# Udacity - Finding Donors
## Overview
This was my fifth class on Machine Learning in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. I learned about the process of machine learning, the different types of machine learning models and how to train and use them, and I learned about the math behind some of the more common models. This class taught me about exploring a dataset, then creating a testing and training set for the model to train on. I learned about normalizing features to optimize the data to work better with the models, and even on making naive predictions on the data and how helpful these baseline predictions can be.
